// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
if a = % 2 
  a = EVEN
else
  a = ODD
// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

# a,b,c,d,e
a+b+c+d+e / 5 = n
{a-e} if a > {b-e}, then a = n
else
b > {a-e}, then b = n
else
c > {a-e}, then c = n
else
d > {a-e}, then d = n
else
e > {a-e}, then e = n
{a-e} if a < {b-e}, then a = n
else
b < {a-e}, then b = n
else
c < {a-e}, then c = n
else
d < {a-e}, then d = n
else
e < {a-e}, then e = n

add the numbers a through e, then divide by five to get the average of the five numbers
input numbers, if number is largest it is the maximum, if it is smallest it is minimum

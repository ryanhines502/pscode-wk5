// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
if a = % 2 
  a = EVEN
else
  a = ODD
// Exercise 3:

b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

# a,b,c,d,e
a+b+c+d+e / 5 = b
{a-e} find largest/smallest sum
